    Hey folks,
One of our long term roommates is unfortunately leaving Berlin ðŸ’”, so a room & his furniture will become available from January 2nd. It is a spacious 32m room in a 2 storey WG with 4 other roommates; Jonathan (Myself), Emma, Steph & Antoinette - we live in a calm and relaxed environment so if you're looking for a party place this isn't for you. We work and study between home and studios/offices in a variety of tech and creative fields - so if you need to home office too, there's plenty of space!  Ideally looking a queer man as his replacement to keep a balance in the apartment. (No couples or petsðŸ¤§)
The price of the room is 650â‚¬/month(All utilities included) with 1 month deposit and a furniture takeover fee of 300â‚¬ (This includes a large double bed, pillows, duvet, sofa bed, cushions, coffee table, wardrobe, 3 side tables, lamps) with an optional new Samsung TV and stand for 400â‚¬. 
(Pictures of this can be provided separately- the furniture is not the one in the pictures)
Please send a DM with some info about yourself. We will be arranging either in-person meetings or video calls in the coming days.
