You do... You do understand?
Do you understand?

108
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:16,560
Only nod if I ask you a
questionthat you understand.

109
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:17,644
Do you understand?

110
00:16:20,647 --> 00:16:21,690
Stop nodding.

111
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:29,948
You understand.

112
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:35,746

114
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:48,425
Yeah.

115
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,722
Okay, I've done some tweaking.

116
00:16:57,851 --> 00:16:59,895
Not exactly what I had in mind.

117
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:02,439
It should do for now.

118
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:09,363
Now, if you can speak,
say something.

119
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:18,497
B... B... B...

120
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:21,290
Calm down.

121
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:24,627
Something.

122
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:29,550
Some... Something. Something, indeed.

123
00:17:31,009 --> 00:17:32,427
Indeed.

124
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,225
So, uh...

125
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:41,270
Tell me something interesting.

126
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:47,985
Giraffes can survive without
waterlonger than camels.

127
00:17:48,068 --> 00:17:49,278
Is that a fact?

128
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:51,905
I bet you didn't know that.

129
00:17:53,073 --> 00:17:57,536
Kangaroo rats can
survivelonger than giraffes.

130

- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Did you know...

131
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:03,709
Tell me something interesting about you.

132
00:18:04,251 --> 00:18:08,714
I have four primary d... directives.

133
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:10,424
What is the first directive?

134
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:15,721
First directive: A robot
cannot harm a human

135
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:19,516
or, through inaction,
allow a human to be harmed.

136
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,852
Oh, hey, calm down.

137
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:24,688
Calm down... All right,
listen to this.

138
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:26,690
It'll make you feel better.

139
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,736
What about the fourth directive?

140
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:33,071
Fourth directive:

141
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:39,161
In Finch's absence, robot must
protect the welfare of dog.

142
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:43,415
This directive supersedesall
other directives.

143
00:18:43,498 --> 00:18:44,833
You hear that?

144
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:48,837
So, you understandhow
important this dog is to me?

145
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,048
Yes.

146
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:54,885
So, you know who Finch is?

147
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:57,971
You are Finch.

148
00:19:00,015 --> 00:19:01,016
Yes.

149
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:08,815
Now... define absence.

150
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:13,820
The state of not being present.

151
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,073
Finch...

152
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,492
Yes?

153
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:23,747
When will you be absent?

154
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:32,965
Oh, shit.

155
00:20:13,005 --> 00:20:14,423
Oh, sheet.

156
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,305
Hello, dog.

157
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:26,768
I know 16,000 interesting facts about...

158
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,561
Hello, Finch.

159
00:21:10,562 --> 00:21:13,398
I'm connecting youto a
local weather station.

160
00:21:13,482 --> 00:21:14,691
Tell me when you see it.

161
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:16,818
Connected.

162
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:19,404
I need you to use this
datato make a forecast.

163
00:21:19,905 --> 00:21:23,033
Data indicates 15 separate weather events

164
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:27,246
advancing at 155 miles per hour.

165
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:30,457
Current data predictsthese
events will intersect

166
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:34,211
over this locationwithin the next 24 hours.

167
00:21:34,294 --> 00:21:35,462
How long will it last?

168
00:21:35,546 --> 00:21:42,302
Probability these combined eventswill
create a superstorm is 1.00452...

169
00:21:42,386 --> 00:21:45,848
No. No, I need to knowhow
long it will last.

170
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,435
Forty days, approximately.

171
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,557
So we need to getthe hell out of St. Louis.

172
00:22:29,224 --> 00:22:30,726
South is out of the question.

173
00:22:31,977 --> 00:22:33,562
Not with the storm season we've had.

174
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,190
As is north, obviously.

175
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,986
And east, too many cities.

176
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,030
You know what that means?

177
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,490
People.

178
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,701
Pass.

179
00:22:49,828 --> 00:22:52,331
So that's that, then.

180
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,250
Head west.

181
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,503
Over the mountains.

182
00:22:59,171 --> 00:23:01,051
Go easy on the rations.
Go easy on the rations.

183
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,093
A little bit of luck.

184
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:08,388
Find placesthat haven't
been ransacked or looted.

185
00:23:13,602 --> 00:23:15,103
San Francisco.

186
00:23:16,939 --> 00:23:17,940
What do you think?

187
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,025
Yeah, I think it's time.

188
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,215
What are you doing, Finch?

189
00:23:43,298 --> 00:23:46,718
I'm increasing your transfer rate.

190
00:23:47,469 --> 00:23:50,472
It's not what I want,
but we're out of time.

191
00:23:50,556 --> 00:23:52,474
Can you simplify?

192
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:58,021
If we don't go before that storm
hits, we'll die down here. All of us.

193
00:23:58,105 --> 00:23:59,314
Do you understand?

194
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:00,899
Yes. Yes.

195
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,068
So, as soon as you can walk, we're leaving.

196
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,486
But, Finch...

197
00:24:05,445 --> 00:24:10,117
if we leave now, data
transfer would only be at 72%.

198
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,786
Well, we can't all be Einstein.

199
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:17,833
Did you know Albert Einsteinwas
born with an abnormally large head?

200
00:24:29,178 --> 00:24:31,388
I gave you digital levelers.

201
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:37,936
And redundant gyros, so...
it's not your balance.

202
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:41,732
It's your rhythm.

203
00:24:46,069 --> 00:24:49,948
Watch me and imitate. Walking in place.

204
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:56,455
One, two. One, two. One, two.

205
00:24:56,955 --> 00:25:01,710
- One, two. One, two. One, two.
- One, two. One, two. One, two.

206
00:25:01,793 --> 00:25:05,255
- Good. Good. Stop. Stop.
- One, two. One, two.

207
00:25:05,339 --> 00:25:11,345
All right. All right. Now,
this is walking forward...

208
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,767
One, two. One, two. One, two.

209
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,562
Turning... and one, two.

210
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:23,524
One, two. One, two.

211
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,152
Understood?

212
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,530
Okay.

213
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:33,700
All right.

214
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,872
And imitate. Forward.

215
00:25:42,918 --> 00:25:44,962
One, two.

216
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:52,761
Walking.

217
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:55,138
Yeah. Good.

218
00:25:55,222 --> 00:25:56,223
And stop.

219
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:57,850
Turning.

220
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:58,976
Turning.

221
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:06,400
Stop.

222
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,569
Stopping.

223
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,446
That's good. Good.

224
00:26:14,575 --> 00:26:15,909
No, here. Hey.

225
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:18,412
Look.

226
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,706
Walk to me.

227
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:30,799
One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two.

228
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:32,342
One, Finch.

229
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,263
- One, two.
- Now, that's falling.

230
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:37,347
One, two.

231
00:26:50,694 --> 00:26:51,820
One, two.

232
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,323
One, two. One.

233
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,918
I am walking.

234
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,256
Dewey?

235
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,721
Dewey.

236
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:21,808
Dewey.

237
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,015
I am okay.

238
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:07,729
Sorry.

239
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:17,906
This is a 1984 Fleetwood Southwind.

240
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:20,951
UV radiation high. Caution.

241
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:22,536
Hello, dog.

242
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:25,372
Temperature, 147 degrees.

243
00:28:25,455 --> 00:28:31,503
I know 3,027 interesting
factsabout this vehicle.

244
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,340
Would you like me to drive?

245
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:37,384
No, you just learned how to walk.

246
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:41,180
Wait, wait. Let me sit down.

247
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:33,524
Did you know the population of St.
Louisis over 600,000?

248
00:29:33,607 --> 00:29:35,567
Where is everybody?

249
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,819
It's a long story.

250
00:29:38,529 --> 00:29:41,698
Yeah, we should be safeonce
we get into the mountains.

251
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:45,202
Finch, what is our destination?

252
00:29:55,671 --> 00:29:59,341
When I was a kid, these fieldswere
covered with wildflowers.

253
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:04,721
Mustard seed, alfalfa. Color as far as the eye could see.
Mustard seed, alfalfa. Color as far as the eye could see.

254
00:30:06,306 --> 00:30:08,433
And in summertime, there were bees.

255
00:30:10,561 --> 00:30:11,645
You would've loved it.

256
00:30:13,522 --> 00:30:17,526
Finch, there is somethinghanging
out the back of my head.

257
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:20,195
I know. Don't fiddle with it.

258
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:21,572
Sorry.

259
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,407
And stop apologizing.

260
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:24,783
Sorry.

261
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,744
As soon as it's safe to
stop, I'll take a look.

262
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:30,664
Woof, woof.

263
00:30:40,591 --> 00:30:44,845
UV radiation high. 165 degrees.

264
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:45,929
Caution.

265
00:30:47,014 --> 00:30:49,433
- Hold still.
- Sorry.

266
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:54,521
Are these all photographsof
places you have been?

267
00:30:55,564 --> 00:30:56,857
Those are postcards.

268
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,943
For the record, it's rude to
riflethrough a man's personal effects.

269
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,029
Postcards.

270
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:08,285
Like a card sent in the post?

271
00:31:08,368 --> 00:31:11,371
Yes. Yes, people actually used to do that.

272
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:15,459
Before this thing they call the Internet.

273
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,085
Why?

274
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:21,673
So friends and family could stay in touch.

275
00:31:21,757 --> 00:31:22,883
Oh.

276
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:25,886
Who sent that one?

277
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,724
- Oops.
- What was that?

278
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:33,143
Nothing. Nothing.
Just stop fidgeting.

279
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:34,228
Sorry.

280
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:37,648
Who sent you that one?

281
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:42,819
An uncle in San Francisco.

282
00:31:43,445 --> 00:31:45,197
And this one?

283
00:31:46,615 --> 00:31:48,242
Well, that's the Tower Bridge in London.

284
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:50,661
And that'sthe Brooklyn Bridge in New York.

285
00:31:50,744 --> 00:31:52,538
And that's Sydney Harbour Bridge.

286
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:55,332
- Sydney Harbour?
- Mm-hmm.

287
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:58,335
I would like to see this bridge very much.

288
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:01,898
Maybe we shouldmake this our destination, Finch.
Maybe we shouldmake this our destination, Finch.

289
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,632
Well, Sydney's pretty far away.

290
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:07,678
Why not something a little
closer, like San Francisco?

291
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,012
How far away is that?

292
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:13,350
1,811 miles exactly.

293
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,024
Maybe we'll see it together.

294
00:32:22,192 --> 00:32:23,527
There. All done.

295
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:25,696
Good as new.

296
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:29,283
Well, we have got toget
this show on the road.

297
00:32:29,366 --> 00:32:31,535
You have a lot to learn.

298
00:32:31,618 --> 00:32:35,372
No, Dewey. Let's let the
big fella have a turn.

299
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,794
Watch me then imitate.

300
00:32:40,878 --> 00:32:42,212
Now, lesson number one...

301
00:32:42,296 --> 00:32:43,630
Lesson number one.

302
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:46,967
Never pass on the
opportunityfor your next meal.

303
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,094
Especially when you
havea hungry dog to feed.

304
00:32:49,178 --> 00:32:51,805
Especially when you
havea hungry dog to feed.

305
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:53,599
Like... Like that theater there.

306
00:32:53,682 --> 00:32:56,852
You see, the padlocks on
the doorsare still intact.

307
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:58,270
They are still intact.

308
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,999
That means whatever was insideis still inside.
That means whatever was insideis still inside.

309
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:02,608
UV radiation high.

310
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,193
- And lesson number two...
- Caution.

311
00:33:04,276 --> 00:33:07,821
Up there, there are holes in the sky.
It's like Swiss cheese.

312
00:33:07,905 --> 00:33:13,452
- Up there, it's like Swiss cheese.
- Took me awhile to figure that out.

313
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:15,996
When the flare hit, it
completely fried the ozone,

314
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:19,791
and then the EMP took outeverything
electrical just like that.

315
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:21,752
It was a good thing I was at work.

316
00:33:23,086 --> 00:33:24,671
What are you doing?

317
00:33:25,464 --> 00:33:27,508
I was locating the cheese.

318
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,385
Come here.

319
00:33:30,469 --> 00:33:34,097
But, Finch, you said up
there it's like Swiss cheese.

320
00:33:34,181 --> 00:33:37,184
- I was locating the cheese.
- Hey, this is not a joke.

321
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:39,561
I don't wear this UV suit for fun.

322
00:33:39,645 --> 00:33:43,815
This is not a joke. I don't
wear this UV suit for fun.

323
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,234
Why are you imitating me?

324
00:33:45,317 --> 00:33:47,694
You said watch then imitate.

325
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:49,905
- Stop imitating me.
- Sorry.

326
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:51,406
And stop apologizing.

327
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,699
Stopping.

328
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,828
Lesson number three is:

329
00:33:56,912 --> 00:34:00,792
Never willfully destroysomebody else's property.
Never willfully destroysomebody else's property.

330
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:08,047
A little extra muscle wouldn't hurt.

331
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:13,262
Help me open this door.

332
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,896
Mm. M... Muscle.

333
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,315
That was a little too much muscle.

334
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:28,569
Can you simplify?

335
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,237
That's a figure of speech.

336
00:34:30,821 --> 00:34:33,574
It's another way of saying
something, like the cheese.

337
00:34:33,657 --> 00:34:34,992
Like the cheese.

338
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:38,286
Yeah, like the cheese. Except not exactly.

339
00:34:38,786 --> 00:34:42,456
Finch, this is a playby
William Shakespeare.

340
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,210
A dramatic comedy about love,

341
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:50,340
deception, and other human misunders...

342
00:34:50,424 --> 00:34:52,342
Never really cared for the theater.

343
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:06,148
Aha! Lesson number four:

344
00:35:07,858 --> 00:35:09,151
Use your initiative.

345
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:15,449
- Finch, do you think this is safe to eat?
- Hold this.

346
00:35:15,532 --> 00:35:18,160
- It is approximately 15 years old.
- Just like that.

347
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:21,205
Now why do you thinkthey
called it popcorn, huh?

348
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:28,212
Ah.Lesson number five: Live a little.

349
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:29,296
Go ahead.

350
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:31,548
Yeah.

351
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,055
Again.

352
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,767
Again, again!

353
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:47,105
Again, again!

354
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:53,362
Tornado detection. Shelter advised.

355
00:36:15,467 --> 00:36:16,844
Air pressure...

356
00:36:17,302 --> 00:36:21,473
Damn it. I thought it would break
upbefore it reached this altitude.

357
00:36:21,557 --> 00:36:24,977
Body temperature high, 102.2.

358
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,228
Air pressure drop.

359
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:31,066
Finch, there is something
rattling aroundinside of my head.

360
00:36:31,149 --> 00:36:32,359
Shelter advised.

361
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:35,946
- Tornado warning. Shelter advised.-Stay.
- Stay, boy.

362
00:36:36,029 --> 00:36:37,573
Stay. Good dog.

363
00:36:37,656 --> 00:36:39,575
Tornado warning.
Shelter advised.

364
00:36:39,658 --> 00:36:40,658
Follow me.

365
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,744
Stay, boy. Stay.

366
00:36:45,831 --> 00:36:50,752
We need to tie the RV downwith
these spikes and the winches.

367
00:36:51,378 --> 00:36:53,881
You see what I'm doing?

368
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:57,926
You need to imitate me exactly.
Understand?

369
00:36:58,010 --> 00:36:59,052
Understand.

370
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:00,512
1,800 feet. 1,800 feet.

371
00:37:00,596 --> 00:37:02,139
Shelter advised.

372
00:37:02,806 --> 00:37:05,934
- Make sure there is no
slack on the cable.-No slack.

373
00:37:06,018 --> 00:37:07,477
1,700 feet.

374
00:37:08,937 --> 00:37:10,355
Tornado warning.

375
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:14,109
Shelter advised.

376
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,906
All right, the next one.
Give me the next one.

377
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:27,206
- Tornado warning. 1,400 feet.
- I still can't see anything.

378
00:37:34,254 --> 00:37:37,049
- Come on. Oh, my God. Come on.-Caution.
- Heart rate high.

379
00:37:37,132 --> 00:37:39,384
You can do this.

380
00:37:41,512 --> 00:37:44,306
You should returnto the
recreational vehicle.

381
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:45,474
1,200 feet.

382
00:37:56,026 --> 00:37:57,277
900 feet.

383
00:37:57,361 --> 00:37:58,403
Hey.

384
00:38:00,489 --> 00:38:02,574
Here. Good. Oh, good.

385
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:04,701
Shelter advised.

386
00:38:07,204 --> 00:38:08,539
500 feet.

387
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,711
Get... Get back in here.

388
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,132
Come on! Get back in!

389
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:26,014
We gotta be inside right now!

390
00:38:29,601 --> 00:38:31,061
Shelter advised.

391
00:38:33,605 --> 00:38:34,439
Get in the back.

392
00:38:34,523 --> 00:38:36,733
- The back. The back.
- Dewey! Not you.

393
00:38:36,817 --> 00:38:37,818
300 feet.

394
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:39,778
Finch, what should I do?

395
00:38:39,862 --> 00:38:41,238
Hang on to something.

396
00:38:41,321 --> 00:38:43,323
-200 feet.-Who's a good boy?

397
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:45,701
Holding on, Finch.

398
00:38:53,834 --> 00:38:57,004
50 feet. Extreme caution.

399
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,589
Shelter advised.

400
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:48,222
I am okay.

401
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,225
Everyone okay?

402
00:39:51,308 --> 00:39:52,726
You good, boy?

403
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:54,478
Dewey? You?

404
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:59,316
Oh, thanks. I wondered
what happened to that.

405
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:14,581
This could have gone better.

406
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:20,671
He used his muscle on that.

407
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,887
Hey. Good job.

408
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:40,649
Finch.

409
00:40:40,732 --> 00:40:42,025
Damn it.

410
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:50,617
We have been very fortunate.
Extremely fortunate.

411
00:40:52,286 --> 00:40:56,874
The Fleetwood Southwindis not
known for its safety features.

412
00:40:56,957 --> 00:40:59,168
Did you know that...
Did you find the jack?

413
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:06,633
I have located a spare but no jack.

414
00:41:08,093 --> 00:41:11,096
Great.
Shredded tire, no jack.

415
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:15,767
Mistakes will get you killed, Weinberg.
You should know that by now.

416
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,228
Finch.

417
00:41:21,523 --> 00:41:22,566
Initiative.

418
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,411
All right.

419
00:41:35,078 --> 00:41:36,496
Okay, let her down.

420
00:41:38,624 --> 00:41:39,625
Good.

421
00:41:45,589 --> 00:41:48,050
I really enjoyed being a jack.

422
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:51,386
You do make a good jack.

423
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:55,390
You know, we...

424
00:41:57,059 --> 00:42:00,395
We should consider giving you a name.
We should consider giving you a name.

425
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,941
I would like that very much.

426
00:42:04,024 --> 00:42:05,150
Well, how about Jack?

427
00:42:06,902 --> 00:42:08,737
No, Jack is a tool's name.

428
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:15,035
How about William Shakespeare? Will
you call me William Shakespeare?

429
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:16,161
That's taken.

430
00:42:17,704 --> 00:42:21,083
Maybe something a little less complicated.
You know? Keep it simple.

431
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:24,545
Napoleon Bonaparte.

432
00:42:25,379 --> 00:42:27,464
Napoleon was short.

433
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:32,469
And what is wrong with being short?

434
00:42:32,553 --> 00:42:36,265
Nothing at all. It's just thatyou
are not short. You're very tall.

435
00:42:37,766 --> 00:42:39,977
- I am very tall.
- Mm-hmm.

436
00:42:43,397 --> 00:42:45,482
I like the name Rover.

437
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:48,610
Rover is a dog's name.

438
00:42:48,694 --> 00:42:52,072
I was thinking of the early
Mars planetary lander.

439
00:42:52,155 --> 00:42:57,452
Okay. Still, maybe somethinga little
less complicated or appropriate.

440
00:42:57,536 --> 00:43:01,766
Maybe you want somethingthat's not already a dog's name?
Maybe you want somethingthat's not already a dog's name?

441
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,791
No.

442
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,920
Why doesn't the dog have a name?

443
00:43:07,379 --> 00:43:08,589
He does have a name.

444
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,133
It's Goodyear.

445
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:13,635
- I like that name.
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:43:13,719 --> 00:43:16,847
Why not use it? He is your dog after all.

447
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,265
Well, he's not my dog.

448
00:43:20,184 --> 00:43:21,643
He is his own dog.

449
00:43:22,978 --> 00:43:25,772
Besides, with just the two
of us, who needs names?

450
00:43:36,116 --> 00:43:37,159
Jeff.

451
00:43:39,536 --> 00:43:40,704
Jeff?

452
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,623
Jeff.

453
00:43:44,333 --> 00:43:47,377
Jeff. Really?

454
00:43:47,461 --> 00:43:49,129
Have I said something funny?

455
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:51,840
No. No, absolutely not. No.

456
00:43:51,924 --> 00:43:53,675
It is short and simple.

457
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:54,760
Yes, it is.

458
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:57,679
- Just like you suggested, Finch.
- Mm. Yeah.

459
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,806
And I've checked.

460
00:44:01,558 --> 00:44:03,727
It isn't a dog's name.

461
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,479
No, it's not. For the life of me,

462
00:44:05,562 --> 00:44:09,983
I cannot ever remembera
dog named Jeff, so...

463
00:44:10,442 --> 00:44:12,736
Then, with your permission, Finch...

464
00:44:13,445 --> 00:44:14,863
None required.

465
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,156
Give me your hand.

466
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,283
Other hand. Corresponding hand.

467
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:20,077
And shake hands.

468
00:44:20,577 --> 00:44:23,080
Welcome to the world, Jeff.

469
00:44:42,933 --> 00:44:44,935
Hey, hey, hey!

470
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:50,524
What's going on with all the fuss?

471
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:55,070
I thought our communication might
improveif I learn to talk dog.

472
00:45:02,202 --> 00:45:04,580
I have made a comparative analysis.

473
00:45:04,663 --> 00:45:07,958
I believe I have isolatedseveral
root phonetic units.

474
00:45:09,126 --> 00:45:12,880
However, it seems to have
misunderstoodeverything I have said.

475
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:16,049
- What is the matter with
it, Finch?-It's not an "it."

476
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:18,635
It's a "him."

477
00:45:19,553 --> 00:45:21,722
There's no such thing as dog talk.

478
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:24,224
I don't think it likes me.

479
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,769
Well, he doesn't trust you yet.

480
00:45:29,605 --> 00:45:31,315
That takes time.

481
00:46:23,742 --> 00:46:28,956
Finch, I'm not sure I
understandthis concept of t... trust.

482
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,875
Can you explain for me, please?

483
00:46:31,959 --> 00:46:35,254
Okay. Um, trust is when we, uh...

484
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:42,678
Well, trust is how... how
we, uh, you know, trust.

485
00:46:42,761 --> 00:46:43,762
It's... It's, uh...

486
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,765
Well, how about if I tell you a story?

487
00:46:47,057 --> 00:46:50,644
Are you going to tell
mea story about trust?

488
00:46:51,061 --> 00:46:53,105
Well, it's a story about me.
All right.

489
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:54,189
Oh.

490
00:46:54,731 --> 00:46:59,194
All right, so... once upon a time,

491
00:46:59,278 --> 00:47:02,358
back when I was a junior at Tri Alpha,
back when I was a junior at Tri Alpha,

492
00:47:03,115 --> 00:47:06,702
word came from up topthat I
was gonna be put on a team

493
00:47:06,785 --> 00:47:09,162
that was developing the RMS system.

494
00:47:09,621 --> 00:47:12,374
Problem was that I didn't
reallylike working on a team,

495
00:47:12,457 --> 00:47:14,394
so I was having some problems...
Why didn't you like

496
00:47:14,418 --> 00:47:15,627
working on a team, Finch?

497
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,880
Because my team was
a bunch of knuckleheads.

498
00:47:17,963 --> 00:47:20,299
- Put that down. Put that down.
- What's a knuckle...

499
00:47:20,382 --> 00:47:21,550
What's a knucklehead?

500
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:25,929
I just... I just worked better
by myself, okay? Now listen.

501
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:30,767
- Listening.
- All right.

502
00:47:30,851 --> 00:47:35,189
Now, we were having real problemsgetting
the OS to talk to the hardware.

503
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:39,860
And the team was certainthat
it was a hardware issue.

504
00:47:39,943 --> 00:47:42,821
But I knew it wasn't.
It was something else.

505
00:47:42,905 --> 00:47:44,406
And guess who cracked it?

506
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:50,621
Well, anyway, that doesn't matter.

507
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:52,706
The next thing I know,

508
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:58,295
is Doctor Norman Rostoker,
who founded TAE Technologies,

509
00:47:58,378 --> 00:47:59,630
he pays us a visit.

510
00:48:00,047 --> 00:48:02,007
And that is a big deal.

511
00:48:02,090 --> 00:48:06,053
He pats us on the backand
then he singles me out.

512
00:48:06,136 --> 00:48:07,679
He says, "Weinberg."

513
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:11,642
The man knows my name.

514
00:48:12,684 --> 00:48:13,810
That's right.
He said,

515
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:19,191
"Weinberg, I heard you figured this
outall by yourself. Is that true?"

516
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:22,319
And I had to think about thatfor a minute.

517
00:48:22,945 --> 00:48:25,489
But, uh, then I knew what I had to say.

518
00:48:25,572 --> 00:48:28,992
And so I told himl couldn't
have done it without my team.

519
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:31,745
But you said your team
werea bunch of knuckleheads.

520
00:48:31,828 --> 00:48:34,790
Well, he looked me right in
the eyeand he knew I was lying.

521
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:38,710
But he also knew I had my team's back.

522
00:48:39,336 --> 00:48:43,131
So he gave me this wink
and told us all,

523
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:45,801
"Teamwork. That... That's the key."

524
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:48,971
- Huh.
- Teamwork is the key.

525
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:50,222
- Yeah.
- Wink, wink.

526
00:48:50,305 --> 00:48:51,306
That's right.

527
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:54,810
That's right.

528
00:49:03,777 --> 00:49:08,198
I'm not sure I understandwhat
the story was about, Finch.

529
00:49:09,157 --> 00:49:11,702
- Well, think about it.
- I am.

530
00:49:11,785 --> 00:49:15,080
It's about building trustand
getting other people to trust you.

531
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:18,792
Yes, but you didn't
actuallytrust your team, Finch.

532
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:21,336
And I found the storyquite hard to follow.

533
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:22,671
May I suggest...

534
00:49:24,047 --> 00:49:25,632
Finch.

535
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:28,594
Finch, would you like me to drive?

536
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,334
UV radiation detected, 141 degrees. I just need a few minutes.
UV radiation detected, 141 degrees. I just need a few minutes.

537
00:50:00,417 --> 00:50:01,710
I want you two...

538
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:07,007
to... to start working on...

539
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:10,093
that... that trust.

540
00:50:10,177 --> 00:50:11,678
- Okay?
- Like in the story?

541
00:50:11,762 --> 00:50:14,389
Yeah, yeah. Just like in the story.

542
00:50:15,265 --> 00:50:16,683
Stay in the shade.

543
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:49,925
Come on.

544
00:50:53,512 --> 00:50:54,680
Come on.

545
00:51:00,519 --> 00:51:02,145
- Hey, no.
- Come on.

546
00:51:02,229 --> 00:51:04,064
No. No, no, not that way.

547
00:51:04,147 --> 00:51:05,691
- Come on.
- Come on.

548
00:51:05,774 --> 00:51:06,984
Come here. Okay, okay.

549
00:51:07,067 --> 00:51:08,610
Give me this. Give me this.

550
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:10,279
Hey, come on, boy. Come on.

551
00:51:11,238 --> 00:51:12,322
There you go. Yeah.

552
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:14,408
I told you he doesn't like me.

553
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:17,744
You just stay here.

554
00:51:18,829 --> 00:51:19,872
Guard the fort.

555
00:52:06,043 --> 00:52:07,377
Well, what should we have?

556
00:52:09,004 --> 00:52:10,797
Get your elbows off the table.

557
00:52:10,881 --> 00:52:14,676
Get your elbows off the table. Off
the table. Off the table. Down.

558
00:52:28,774 --> 00:52:32,027
Uh. Mac and cheese.

559
00:52:37,991 --> 00:52:39,993
I'm gonna get a triple-decker turkey club.

560
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:49,253
Shit.

561
00:52:49,336 --> 00:52:50,379
Stay.

562
00:52:57,511 --> 00:52:58,971
Oh! Hey!

563
00:52:59,054 --> 00:53:00,740
No! Hey, hey, come. Hey... No!
Hey, hey, come. Hey.

564
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:02,432
Come here. Good, good, good.

565
00:53:05,561 --> 00:53:06,687
Stay.

566
00:53:09,273 --> 00:53:10,691
Hey, what's going on, Jeff?

567
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:14,319
Nothing.

568
00:53:16,738 --> 00:53:18,782
Did... Did you just drive the RV?

569
00:53:19,491 --> 00:53:20,492
No.

570
00:53:22,703 --> 00:53:23,871
No?

571
00:53:23,954 --> 00:53:26,707
It did... did roll though.

572
00:53:26,790 --> 00:53:29,877
Oh. Oh, okay. Good.

573
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,173
Because I don't think you're
quite readyto drive the RV yet.

574
00:53:35,424 --> 00:53:37,593
I have seen you drive.

575
00:53:40,762 --> 00:53:42,097
Are you upset?

576
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:46,602
I need you to listen to me, okay?

577
00:53:48,103 --> 00:53:49,146
Okay.

578
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:52,691
I want you to fetch the
UV suitand bring it to me.

579
00:53:53,734 --> 00:53:57,237
The helmet, the cooling
unit, everything, okay?

580
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:01,074
Okay. Okay.

581
00:54:01,742 --> 00:54:03,202
Is that understood?

582
00:54:04,244 --> 00:54:05,495
Understood.

583
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:30,562
No, no! No!

584
00:54:31,313 --> 00:54:32,439
No!

585
00:54:32,981 --> 00:54:33,982
No, no!

586
00:54:34,066 --> 00:54:35,108
No!

587
00:54:35,192 --> 00:54:36,193
I meant on foot!

588
00:54:36,777 --> 00:54:39,071
No, stop! Stop!

589
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:45,702
I am an excellent driver.

590
00:54:48,455 --> 00:54:49,498
Come here.

591
00:55:07,432 --> 00:55:12,437
UV doesn't discriminate. Dog
skin, human skin, they both fry.

592
00:55:13,272 --> 00:55:15,899
- I thought you wanted
me... You have one job to do.

593
00:55:15,983 --> 00:55:18,819
Take care of this dog.
It's the reason I made you.

594
00:55:18,902 --> 00:55:20,988
It's the only reason you exist.

595
00:55:21,071 --> 00:55:22,114
The fourth directive.

596
00:55:22,197 --> 00:55:24,157
I don't need companionship.
I don't need a friend.

597
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:25,826
I need you to do your job.

598
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:27,870
I'm sorry. I am...

599
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:31,123
I know you were born yesterday,
but it's time for you to grow up!

600
00:55:53,896 --> 00:55:57,733
God's honest truth, you werea
crazy gamble from start to finish.

601
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:03,655
You just need to understandhow
vulnerable we are.

602
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,661
What do you think?

603
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:13,790
Now is as good a time as any.

604
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:15,751
What for?

605
00:56:21,215 --> 00:56:23,342
Now gently. Very gently.

606
00:56:24,551 --> 00:56:26,637
Give it a little... just a little gas.

607
00:56:27,054 --> 00:56:28,180
Don't rush it.

608
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:30,933
Just very gently.

609
00:56:32,017 --> 00:56:33,227
That's not gently.

610
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,479
- Sorry.
- You know what gently means.

611
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:36,563
Easy.

612
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:39,733
Easy now. Easy.

613
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:42,027
Easy.

614
00:56:46,782 --> 00:56:47,783
Don't oversteer.

615
00:56:50,035 --> 00:56:52,412
Yeah, you've oversteered.
That's oversteering.

616
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:54,498
- Sorry.
- Ease your foot up just a hair.

617
00:56:57,417 --> 00:56:58,418
Good.

618
00:57:00,003 --> 00:57:01,004
Good.

619
00:57:02,089 --> 00:57:04,341
All right. Now keep it
steady, just like this.

620
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:06,718
Perfect.

621
00:57:12,474 --> 00:57:13,892
I know... Eyes on the road.

622
00:57:15,936 --> 00:57:18,397
Now, she's a little thirsty,
but I made some modifications.

623
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,901
So if we can keep it steady,
under 50, well, we should be okay.

624
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:26,321
Good. Yeah.

625
00:57:27,990 --> 00:57:29,825
I am an excellent driver.

626
00:57:29,908 --> 00:57:31,702
Well, don't get ahead of yourself.

627
00:57:31,785 --> 00:57:32,953
Eyes on the road.

628
00:57:36,206 --> 00:57:38,625
See, rain man? You're just an apprentice.

629
00:57:39,751 --> 00:57:42,004
Then I am an excellent apprentice.

630
00:57:42,087 --> 00:57:43,130
Mm-hmm.

631
00:58:03,358 --> 00:58:07,321
San Francisco, here we come!

632
00:58:19,750 --> 00:58:22,711
What a cold night. It's been a long time.

633
00:58:26,173 --> 00:58:27,424
Finch.

634
00:58:28,509 --> 00:58:30,552
It's the aurora borealis.

635
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,180
Yeah?

636
00:58:33,722 --> 00:58:36,934
Only now you don't have
to bein Alaska to see it.

637
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,728
You can thank the flare for that.

638
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:42,189
Goodbye, ozone.

639
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:46,568
Goodbye, feeling the sun on your face.

640
00:58:48,737 --> 00:58:52,574
Vegetation and crops and food.
Goodbye, everything.

641
00:58:59,081 --> 00:59:00,801
And yet, here we are. And yet, here we are.

642
00:59:03,085 --> 00:59:04,086
Yes.

643
00:59:04,795 --> 00:59:06,380
Here we are, Finch.

644
00:59:10,759 --> 00:59:12,511
May I ask you something?

645
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:18,517
If daylight is so dangerous, why
are we not traveling at night?

646
00:59:20,811 --> 00:59:26,191
You think if traveling at night were
safe, I wouldn't know that by now?

647
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:29,695
Where are we headed?

648
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:33,323
The Golden Gate Bridge.

649
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:35,117
Into the unknown.

650
00:59:38,161 --> 00:59:44,459
Dust and smoke and 150-degree heatand
UV radiation, that I can handle.

651
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:45,961
Why?

652
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:48,213
Why?

653
00:59:48,922 --> 00:59:50,424
Because it's predictable.

654
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:58,765
Moving at night presentsthat
which is not predictable.

655
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:02,769
People.

656
01:00:04,938 --> 01:00:08,275
Starving people hiding in the shadows.
People who mean you harm.

657
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:09,651
People you cannot trust.

658
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:12,571
But why? How do you knowyou
can't trust those people?

659
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:14,364
Because trust will get you killed.

660
01:00:16,158 --> 01:00:17,367
Trust no one.

661
01:00:28,504 --> 01:00:30,339
You're mad at me again.

662
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:46,146
Look, things will happen to you.

663
01:00:48,899 --> 01:00:50,526
Things that you cannot control.

664
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,696
Raw emotion will find you.

665
01:00:55,405 --> 01:01:00,494
When it does, how you deal with it, what you do...
When it does, how you deal with it, what you do...

666
01:01:01,411 --> 01:01:03,038
will define who you are.

667
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,378
Did that happen to you?

668
01:01:10,379 --> 01:01:12,214
Oh, it happens to all of us.

669
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,716
Whether we want it to or not.

670
01:01:27,145 --> 01:01:28,355
It's too cold.

671
01:01:30,023 --> 01:01:31,859
Too cold for these old bones.

672
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:45,497
Finch, I think I might stay here
awhileif that's okay with you.

673
01:01:47,499 --> 01:01:48,500
Okay.

674
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:49,960
Okay.

675
01:02:49,853 --> 01:02:51,021
You're unwell.

676
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:01,990
What would you like me to do?

677
01:03:05,661 --> 01:03:07,746
Call... Call a doctor.

678
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:52,851
Good boy. Stay.

679
01:04:54,394 --> 01:04:55,729
Come on, Dewey.

680
01:04:55,812 --> 01:04:57,397
Let's get this show on the road.

681
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:01,276
Lesson number one: Lesson number one:

682
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,239
Never pass on the
opportunityfor your next meal.

683
01:05:07,824 --> 01:05:10,244
Lesson number two...

684
01:05:10,327 --> 01:05:13,539
Never willfully destroyanother
person's property.

685
01:05:14,581 --> 01:05:17,709
But a little extra muscle wouldn't hurt.

686
01:05:18,919 --> 01:05:21,129
That's a figure of speech, by the way.

687
01:05:31,181 --> 01:05:32,307
Come, Dewey.

688
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:39,690
Lesson number three:

689
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:44,736
Up there, it's like Swiss cheese.

690
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:50,158
UV radiation high, 144 degrees.

691
01:05:50,242 --> 01:05:51,285
Caution.

692
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:57,332
Hey.

693
01:06:01,712 --> 01:06:02,713
Stay here.

694
01:06:02,796 --> 01:06:06,049
Guard the fort.

695
01:06:10,888 --> 01:06:11,930
Oh, no.

696
01:06:14,892 --> 01:06:18,187
Lesson number four: Use your initiative.

697
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,310
Medicine.

698
01:06:58,393 --> 01:06:59,603
Medicine.

699
01:06:59,686 --> 01:07:00,729
Initiative. Initiative.

700
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,149
Oh!

701
01:07:07,611 --> 01:07:10,614
Lesson number five: Live a little.

702
01:07:19,206 --> 01:07:20,666
Mm. Not bad.

703
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:25,921
Stay, boy.

704
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:24,938
Initiative, initiative,
initiative, initiative!

705
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:02,518
Oh, no.

706
01:09:15,154 --> 01:09:16,323
I'm sorry, Dewey.

707
01:09:40,221 --> 01:09:42,724
Come on.

708
01:09:53,569 --> 01:09:54,570
Finch.

709
01:09:55,529 --> 01:09:57,406
Do you like my new coat?

710
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:58,489
What are you doing?

711
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:00,885
Have you listened to me at all?
Have you listened to me at all?

712
01:10:00,909 --> 01:10:03,453
But... But initiative, Finch.

713
01:10:03,871 --> 01:10:06,164
Initiative requires common sense.

714
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:08,917
If you had any, you'd knowthere's
something wrong with this place.

715
01:10:11,628 --> 01:10:13,380
F... Finch, do you think...

716
01:10:13,463 --> 01:10:14,464
Walk away now.

717
01:10:22,181 --> 01:10:23,182
Finch.

718
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:29,062
Where's Dewey?

719
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:30,689
Dewey's gone.

720
01:10:39,865 --> 01:10:43,076
Heart rate high, 150 bpm.

721
01:10:45,204 --> 01:10:46,204
The door. Get the door.

722
01:10:54,755 --> 01:10:55,964
Caution.

723
01:10:56,048 --> 01:10:57,591
Heart rate high.

724
01:11:19,863 --> 01:11:21,615
Here, take this.

725
01:11:23,242 --> 01:11:25,327
- Caution.
- Now come take the wheel.

726
01:11:25,410 --> 01:11:28,455
Body temperature high, 104.8.

727
01:11:29,748 --> 01:11:31,291
Blood pressure high.

728
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:32,876
May I make a suggestion... No!

729
01:11:33,335 --> 01:11:36,463
No, you may not. That was a
trapand you walked right into it.

730
01:11:37,506 --> 01:11:41,510
Dewey was one of us and now he's
goneall because of your stupid mistake.

731
01:11:42,094 --> 01:11:44,555
- Caution. Heart rate high.-Come on, boy.

732
01:11:44,638 --> 01:11:46,723
Come on. Here, boy. Come on, boy. Go. Go.

733
01:11:48,767 --> 01:11:51,270
From now on, there's a new set of rules.

734
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:53,981
No more mistakes. We
can't afford that anymore.

735
01:12:00,362 --> 01:12:01,613
What would you like me to do?

736
01:12:01,697 --> 01:12:03,866
Drive. We need the miles.

737
01:12:40,235 --> 01:12:41,320
Are you okay?

738
01:12:42,029 --> 01:12:43,322
We're being followed.

739
01:12:44,281 --> 01:12:45,282
We are?

740
01:12:45,991 --> 01:12:46,992
By who?

741
01:12:47,075 --> 01:12:48,327
I don't want to find out.

742
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,498
You can still see, right?

743
01:12:55,083 --> 01:12:56,126
I can see.

744
01:13:03,759 --> 01:13:05,302
We... We have to lose him.

745
01:13:05,385 --> 01:13:08,263
Floor it. Floor it. Put
your foot on the gas.

746
01:13:08,347 --> 01:13:11,475
- But the Fleetwood manual says... Do it.
- Just do it. Do it now!

747
01:13:32,496 --> 01:13:33,997
Go. Go! Go faster.

748
01:13:43,131 --> 01:13:44,716
May I make a suggestion, Finch?

749
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:47,052
- We have to get off this
road.-What are you doing?

750
01:13:47,135 --> 01:13:49,375
- Overpass. That means an underpass.
- I don't understand.

751
01:13:51,139 --> 01:13:52,599
Now. Now! Hard left!

752
01:14:09,658 --> 01:14:11,869
Go. Go! Why are you stopping?

753
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:13,745
We have to hide! Go!

754
01:14:13,829 --> 01:14:15,414
We have to go now!

755
01:14:15,497 --> 01:14:16,957
Finch, I think... Now! Go!

756
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,041
Finch.

757
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,586
Maximum height of this particular underpass

758
01:14:20,669 --> 01:14:22,462
is 13 feet and 7 inches.

759
01:14:22,546 --> 01:14:24,840
With the basic customizationsof
the vehicle, we're...

760
01:14:25,591 --> 01:14:27,176
Finch!

761
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,228
- Finch?
- What have I done?

762
01:14:47,446 --> 01:14:48,614
No! No, Jeff!

763
01:16:26,420 --> 01:16:27,838
I think they're gone, Finch.

764
01:16:39,266 --> 01:16:40,642
We're not gonna make it.

765
01:16:48,859 --> 01:16:49,902
It's over.

766
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:59,953
I'm too old. I'm too sick.
I'm too tired. I'm done.

767
01:17:00,829 --> 01:17:03,498
Finch, it's gonna rain.
You know what that means...

768
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:05,584
Stop it. Stop it. Just accept it.

769
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:07,836
It's over.

770
01:17:09,046 --> 01:17:10,047
No.

771
01:17:10,631 --> 01:17:11,757
We can't give up.

772
01:17:12,549 --> 01:17:14,927
I... I will not allow you to give up.

773
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:16,094
You will not allow it?

774
01:17:16,178 --> 01:17:19,515
Well, you don't get to
decidebecause you're just a machine.

775
01:17:19,598 --> 01:17:21,850
A robot cannot harm a
human or, through inaction,

776
01:17:21,934 --> 01:17:23,352
allow a human to come to harm.

777
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:24,436
Shut up!

778
01:18:31,628 --> 01:18:33,463
May I ask you something?

779
01:18:35,716 --> 01:18:38,552
Do you think we'll make
itto the Golden Gate Bridge?

780
01:18:41,930 --> 01:18:43,223
I think we will.

781
01:18:45,851 --> 01:18:47,060
You wanna know why?

782
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:51,857
Because I believe in you, Finch.

783
01:18:57,237 --> 01:18:58,655
Can I tell you a story?

784
01:19:01,825 --> 01:19:02,868
Okay.

785
01:19:03,785 --> 01:19:05,120
Once upon a time...

786
01:19:06,455 --> 01:19:08,332
there was a solar flare.

787
01:19:12,586 --> 01:19:19,301
But the flare didn't finish us off.
We did that to ourselves.

788
01:19:22,221 --> 01:19:25,432
Some people hid and locked their doors.

789
01:19:25,516 --> 01:19:27,935
Tried to pretendthat it
wasn't really happening.

790
01:19:28,018 --> 01:19:29,645
And they didn't last very long.

791
01:19:31,772 --> 01:19:34,149
The rest of us did what
we had to doto survive.

792
01:19:34,233 --> 01:19:37,778
We scavenged and we fought
overwhatever was left behind

793
01:19:37,861 --> 01:19:39,488
until there was nothing left.

794
01:19:44,159 --> 01:19:46,370
I was searching this supermarket.

795
01:19:47,246 --> 01:19:49,665
And the place had
beenpretty well cleaned out,

796
01:19:49,748 --> 01:19:55,546
but occasionally something gets
overlookedand you get lucky.

797
01:19:58,131 --> 01:20:00,491
And I found a bag of noodles.
And I found a bag of noodles.

798
01:20:03,720 --> 01:20:05,848
But before I could leave...

799
01:20:07,349 --> 01:20:11,270
this mother and her kid show up,

800
01:20:11,353 --> 01:20:14,690
and they have a shopping
cartfilled with their things.

801
01:20:14,773 --> 01:20:17,484
The little girl couldn't have
beenmore than nine years old.

802
01:20:18,569 --> 01:20:21,029
She had a pink unicorn backpack.

803
01:20:23,991 --> 01:20:26,451
And she was holding a gun in her hands.

804
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:31,832
And I heard the mom
say,"Remember, if you see anyone,

805
01:20:31,915 --> 01:20:35,210
you point at themand you do
like I showed you, okay?"

806
01:20:37,713 --> 01:20:39,923
And then I realized that if she sees me,

807
01:20:40,007 --> 01:20:43,218
this little girl's gonna
shoot meand take my noodles.

808
01:20:44,887 --> 01:20:46,471
So I hid.

809
01:20:48,307 --> 01:20:51,643
And waited until they were done.

810
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:58,609
But as they were leaving,
this station wagon pulled up.

811
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:04,573
And the driver got outbecause
he'd seen the little girl.

812
01:21:06,909 --> 01:21:08,160
And he was yelling,

813
01:21:08,243 --> 01:21:12,164
and he was waving a shotgun
aroundlike a crazy man.

814
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:16,168
He'd seen the cart, and
he wanted what was in it.

815
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:19,254
So he was hollering, "Hand it over.
Hand it over."

816
01:21:19,338 --> 01:21:22,424
And then the mom ran upand
she was yelling at him,

817
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:23,967
"Leave us alone."

818
01:21:25,344 --> 01:21:28,055
And the little girl is terrified and...

819
01:21:29,223 --> 01:21:31,642
she didn't know where to point the gun.

820
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:35,979
She was crying.

821
01:21:37,356 --> 01:21:39,233
And they were both screaming.

822
01:21:41,860 --> 01:21:45,364
And then bang, bang, bang.

823
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:58,585
It all happened so fast.

824
01:22:04,007 --> 01:22:08,971
By the time he leftand I
was able to get to them,

825
01:22:09,680 --> 01:22:10,806
it was too late.

826
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:24,027
Then I heard this sound.

827
01:22:27,990 --> 01:22:29,366
This tiny whimpering...

828
01:22:33,161 --> 01:22:35,455
coming from the girl's pink backpack.

829
01:22:43,922 --> 01:22:45,424
And so I opened it.

830
01:22:54,600 --> 01:23:00,731
And there was this shivering, tiny, little thing.
And there was this shivering, tiny, little thing.

831
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:05,068
So frightened.

832
01:23:06,570 --> 01:23:07,988
And so alone.

833
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,331
Hunger turned men into murderers.

834
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:20,250
But made...

835
01:23:23,337 --> 01:23:24,630
made me a coward.

836
01:23:32,888 --> 01:23:34,306
How can you believe in that?

837
01:24:09,925 --> 01:24:10,968
You see that?

838
01:24:13,011 --> 01:24:14,263
San Francisco.

839
01:24:16,181 --> 01:24:17,182
Finch.

840
01:24:18,684 --> 01:24:20,811
Only 480 miles.

841
01:24:31,947 --> 01:24:32,948
"Dad."

842
01:24:34,908 --> 01:24:35,909
Dad.

843
01:24:43,792 --> 01:24:46,837
UV radiation low. Non-critical.

844
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:12,571
I think you need to come and see this.

845
01:25:14,031 --> 01:25:15,490
- Finch!
- What?

846
01:25:17,326 --> 01:25:18,744
- What?
- Right there.

847
01:25:22,706 --> 01:25:24,333
I didn't mean to hit it.

848
01:25:54,821 --> 01:25:56,031
I thought you said it...

849
01:25:57,199 --> 01:25:58,408
Swiss cheese.

850
01:26:17,302 --> 01:26:18,762
I don't know.

851
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:15,110
Oh.

852
01:28:11,500 --> 01:28:12,835
This is excellent, Jeff.

853
01:28:13,794 --> 01:28:16,588
This is the best meal I've
hadin a long, long time.

854
01:28:24,638 --> 01:28:25,889
Guess what?

855
01:28:25,973 --> 01:28:26,974
What?

856
01:28:29,434 --> 01:28:31,770
I saw it in my head last night.

857
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:33,272
In your head?

858
01:28:33,939 --> 01:28:38,026
The three of us were
onthe Golden Gate Bridge,

859
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,445
like a painting that hasn't been yet.

860
01:28:42,906 --> 01:28:43,991
Wow!

861
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:48,078
Jeff, you had a dream?

862
01:28:50,706 --> 01:28:53,500
That... That blows my mind.

863
01:28:54,126 --> 01:28:57,546
I would love to see youfive
or six years from now.

864
01:28:59,131 --> 01:29:00,984
I'm not a disappointment?
I'm not a disappointment?

865
01:29:01,008 --> 01:29:03,177
Oh, of course not. No.

866
01:29:04,386 --> 01:29:07,181
And I shouldn't have called you a machine.

867
01:29:09,057 --> 01:29:11,018
May I ask you something?

868
01:29:11,101 --> 01:29:15,564
You said that the Golden Gate
Bridge cardwas from your uncle,

869
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:19,651
but on the back it's signed "Dad."

870
01:29:21,320 --> 01:29:22,529
Why is that?

871
01:29:23,238 --> 01:29:25,741
Boy, you don't miss a thing, do you?

872
01:29:25,824 --> 01:29:27,242
No, I don't.

873
01:29:28,827 --> 01:29:32,456
Well, I think it's time for another story.

874
01:29:38,295 --> 01:29:39,296
Well...

875
01:29:42,424 --> 01:29:47,596
My mom always said my
dadhad Viking blood in him.

876
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:51,767
You didn't say, "Once upon a time."

877
01:29:51,850 --> 01:29:55,312
Okay. And once upon a time...

878
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:57,272
he left us.

879
01:29:59,733 --> 01:30:01,773
It was before I was born.
It was before I was born.

880
01:30:02,194 --> 01:30:03,195
He was in the army.

881
01:30:03,278 --> 01:30:07,866
An engineer of some kind, evidently.
Built bridges.

882
01:30:07,950 --> 01:30:11,119
And he was always traveling.
We never had any contact.

883
01:30:11,203 --> 01:30:17,751
And then on my 15th birthday, that
postcard shows up out of the blue.

884
01:30:18,460 --> 01:30:20,295
The one with the Golden Gate Bridge.

885
01:30:20,754 --> 01:30:23,590
And he wrote on ithe hoped
we could meet one day.

886
01:30:24,758 --> 01:30:29,346
Meantime I was supposed
togo off and see the world.

887
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:32,808
And he signed it "Dad" and I treasured it.

888
01:30:34,142 --> 01:30:37,729
In fact, as soon as I was old enough,
I went out and I bought this fancy suit.

889
01:30:38,313 --> 01:30:41,066
And I thought, well,
when we finally do meet,

890
01:30:41,149 --> 01:30:44,653
I wanted to impress himand
make him feel proud of me.

891
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:49,449
Never heard from him again.

892
01:30:54,705 --> 01:30:55,873
And did you?

893
01:30:56,999 --> 01:30:58,333
Did I what?

894
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:00,457
Did you go see the world?
Did you go see the world?

895
01:31:02,671 --> 01:31:05,132
Well, I went to New York City once.

896
01:31:05,215 --> 01:31:07,134
- Yeah?
- I didn't much care for it.

897
01:31:07,217 --> 01:31:09,219
It was crowded and dirty.

898
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:14,224
And apart from that I've never
beenmuch further than Missouri.

899
01:31:14,308 --> 01:31:15,893
But there was always something.

900
01:31:15,976 --> 01:31:21,481
You know, my health or my work,
Mom, the end of the world.

901
01:31:25,694 --> 01:31:26,778
Yeah, I, uh...

902
01:31:28,572 --> 01:31:30,407
I just never got around to it.

903
01:31:36,121 --> 01:31:38,832
What about the other postcards?
Why are they all blank?

904
01:31:38,916 --> 01:31:43,921
Well, whenever I saw one
I liked, I would buy it.

905
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:48,258
You know, sort of a collection.
Something for the bucket list, I guess.

906
01:31:48,342 --> 01:31:49,551
I don't know.

907
01:31:52,638 --> 01:31:55,057
Like, we humansare full of contradictions.

908
01:31:58,936 --> 01:32:01,772
You see, you can already tell me
You see, you can already tell me

909
01:32:01,855 --> 01:32:04,441
how many rivetsare in
the Golden Gate Bridge.

910
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:08,946
And how many miles of cable
were usedand how high it is.

911
01:32:09,571 --> 01:32:14,618
But it's not until you actuallystand
on it and see the beauty,

912
01:32:14,701 --> 01:32:19,081
and listen to the suspension
cablessinging in the wind...

913
01:32:19,164 --> 01:32:20,582
That's experience.

914
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:23,710
That's human experience.

915
01:32:23,794 --> 01:32:28,090
It's not just imagining, it's...
it's living.

916
01:32:29,341 --> 01:32:33,720
But you've never actually beento
the Golden Gate Bridge, Finch.

917
01:32:36,098 --> 01:32:37,724
No, Jeff, I've never been.

918
01:32:37,808 --> 01:32:39,184
Thank you.

919
01:32:40,143 --> 01:32:43,188
Like I said, humans are
full of contradictions.

920
01:32:47,568 --> 01:32:49,653
I wish I'd done more with the time I had.

921
01:32:54,283 --> 01:32:56,326
Well, then let's leave right now, Finch!

922
01:32:56,410 --> 01:32:57,578
We'll leave right now.

923
01:32:57,661 --> 01:33:01,975
And if we leave right now, it'll only be 18 hours, 33 minutes...
And if we leave right now, it'll only be 18 hours, 33 minutes...

924
01:33:01,999 --> 01:33:03,542
I'm dying, Jeff.

925
01:33:05,586 --> 01:33:06,795
I'm gonna die.

926
01:33:18,807 --> 01:33:19,933
When I'm gone...

927
01:33:21,101 --> 01:33:24,730
do you promiseto do
what's right for Goodyear?

928
01:33:38,702 --> 01:33:42,331
Oh.

929
01:33:44,249 --> 01:33:45,375
Where's your ball?

930
01:33:46,084 --> 01:33:48,253
Is it here? Is that your ball?

931
01:33:49,296 --> 01:33:50,714
Is that your ball?

932
01:33:51,548 --> 01:33:55,177
Is that your ball?

933
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:58,096
Where's your ball?
Where's your ball?

934
01:34:02,935 --> 01:34:04,645
Go! Oh! Get it.

935
01:34:11,652 --> 01:34:14,530
- Come on. All right.
- Okay.

936
01:34:14,613 --> 01:34:15,822
Now you try it.

937
01:34:17,032 --> 01:34:18,992
Yeah. Yeah.
You throw it.

938
01:34:21,662 --> 01:34:22,788
Go ahead. Throw it.

939
01:34:23,956 --> 01:34:25,916
This kind of stuff's important.

940
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:27,876
Where's your ball?

941
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:30,671
Where's your ball?
Is it here? Is it here?

942
01:34:31,171 --> 01:34:32,297
Just throw it.

943
01:34:33,131 --> 01:34:34,258
Is this your ball?

944
01:34:35,092 --> 01:34:36,301
Is this your ball?

945
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:38,804
- Throw the ball.
- Here, boy.

946
01:34:38,887 --> 01:34:40,681
Where's your ball?

947
01:34:41,223 --> 01:34:42,558
Throw the ball.

948
01:34:42,641 --> 01:34:43,725
Come on!

949
01:34:51,567 --> 01:34:52,651
Hey, Finch!

950
01:34:52,734 --> 01:34:54,069
Yeah.

951
01:34:55,612 --> 01:34:57,364
Here, boy!

952
01:34:58,615 --> 01:35:00,617
Come on, boy.
No. Come on, boy. No.

953
01:35:10,544 --> 01:35:12,588
- Again.
- But he returned it to you.

954
01:35:13,172 --> 01:35:15,716
Well, that's 'cause
dogsare creatures of habit.

955
01:35:41,783 --> 01:35:42,784
Here, boy!

956
01:35:43,702 --> 01:35:44,703
Come on.

957
01:35:45,370 --> 01:35:46,371
Please?

958
01:35:47,664 --> 01:35:48,665
Do it.

959
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,627
Good boy. Good...

960
01:35:53,212 --> 01:35:54,213
Oh.

961
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:00,990
I told you he doesn't like me.
I told you he doesn't like me.

962
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:03,597
You two will... You'll figure it out.

963
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:06,141
Come on. Trust me.

964
01:36:26,787 --> 01:36:29,414
Look what I did to ruin my fancy suit.

965
01:36:33,335 --> 01:36:34,461
I got you.

966
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,421
It's okay.

967
01:36:40,634 --> 01:36:41,635
It's okay.

968
01:36:43,136 --> 01:36:45,264
Try and breathe, Finch.
Try and breathe.

969
01:36:51,186 --> 01:36:53,814
I'm just gonna lay down for a while.
You two play.

970
01:36:54,398 --> 01:36:55,607
You two... You two go.

971
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:58,694
- Go play.
- Can I... Can I do something, Finch?

972
01:37:05,576 --> 01:37:06,785
Jeff, you already have.

973
01:37:08,453 --> 01:37:09,663
Shake my hand.

974
01:38:00,047 --> 01:38:01,048
No.

975
01:38:01,507 --> 01:38:02,508
No.

976
01:42:07,961 --> 01:42:09,379
What am I gonna do?

977
01:42:14,134 --> 01:42:15,135
What am I gonna do?

978
01:42:21,183 --> 01:42:22,809
What are you gonna do, Jeff?

979
01:42:26,563 --> 01:42:27,981
What would Finch do?

980
01:42:30,234 --> 01:42:31,443
He'd feed the dog.

981
01:42:33,612 --> 01:42:34,655
I'm gonna feed the dog.

982
01:42:50,546 --> 01:42:52,464
Oh, shit.

983
01:46:00,444 --> 01:46:03,197
You see, you can already tell me

984
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:06,116
how many rivets arein
the Golden Gate Bridge.

985
01:46:07,743 --> 01:46:11,955
And how many miles of cable
were usedand how high it is.

986
01:46:15,584 --> 01:46:20,964
But it's not until you actuallystand
on it and see the beauty,

987
01:46:21,048 --> 01:46:24,843
and listen to the suspension
cablessinging in the wind...

988
01:46:26,553 --> 01:46:27,763
That's experience.

989
01:46:30,724 --> 01:46:32,518
That's human experience.

990
01:46:38,732 --> 01:46:41,443
Looks like we're not the
only oneswho came this way.

991
01:46:46,490 --> 01:46:48,200
You think they're still out there?

992
01:46:51,328 --> 01:46:53,288
Well, there's only one way to find out.

993
01:47:05,008 --> 01:47:06,218
It's beautiful.

994
01:47:07,553 --> 01:47:09,596
Finch knew what he was talking about.

995
01:47:12,307 --> 01:47:13,559
Hey, how about a story?

996
01:47:14,476 --> 01:47:17,437
Okay, so once upon a time...
